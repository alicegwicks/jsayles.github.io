#### Description:
I created a device we call the Philometer from the greek root 'philos', to love and 'metric', to measure.  It measures heart rate (BPM), brain activity (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and body temperature.  At it's heart is an arduino and it uploads the data to a computer via a USB cable.  The data coming in to the computer is graphed in real time using Processing and simultaneously saved as a CSV file.  We can then graph the data in 3D using a python script that imports the CSV in to Rhino. Katie created a few Illustrator templates that further format the data in to the final art peice.
