#### Description:
The front door at The Red Victorian was in need of an entry solution. There was already an electric strike installed in the gate and even a lighted doorbell button.  We looked at all the commercial and residential solutions, and the fancy new "smart locks" that are cropping up like Lockitron and August.  We decided to roll our own because none of the solutions we found had the openness or the API we needed to integrate in to the reservation software we created (modernomad).

I hooked the door up to a Raspberry Pi and a keypad and created a system with expiring keys.  Each guest can have a personal entry code that only works for the length of their reservation and all access is logged.
